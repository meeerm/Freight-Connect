# Freight-Connect
Freight Connect is a platform that brings together shippers, carriers, and freight brokers in one
convenient online marketplace. The primary goal of Freight Connect is to streamline the
process of finding, booking, and managing freight by providing a transparent booking board,
which encourages competitive rates for all parties involve.

In this mini-world, shippers/brokers post their loads with details such as origin, destination,
weight, dimensions, required equipment, and the desired pickup/delivery dates. Carriers browse
the available loads and place bids on the lanes they are interested in transporting.
Shippers/brokers can then review the bids, check the carrierâ€™s performance rating, and select
the best offer.
